# About the Project

Soft robotics is a subfield of robotics that concerns the design, control, and fabrication of robots composed of compliant materials, instead of rigid links. In contrast to rigid-bodied robots built from metals, ceramics and hard plastics, the compliance of soft robots can improve their safety when working in close contact with humans. It is inspired by soft-bodied animals and permits adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments.

In our project we wanted to build a soft robotic gripper, that would lift up fragile objects gently and without breaking them.

Here we will describe our one week long project.
