# Soft Robot Gripper
One-week project: building a soft robot gripper

# About the Project

Soft robotics is a subfield of robotics that concerns the design, control, and fabrication of robots composed of compliant materials, instead of rigid links. In contrast to rigid-bodied robots built from metals, ceramics and hard plastics, the compliance of soft robots can improve their safety when working in close contact with humans. It is inspired by soft-bodied animals and permits adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments.

In our project we wanted to build a soft robotic gripper, that would lift up fragile objects gently and without breaking them.

Here we will describe our one week long project.

# Idea and Design

The initial idea of our project was to build a soft robot gripper. The grippers we considered had four or three fingers. We educated ourselves on benchmark and former projects e.g. on the soft robotics toolkit. Also we initially planned to include a sensor or feedback system, which is explanatory for certain design choices we took afterwards.


# Mold design and development
The mold design was done with the Fusion 360 Software. The model was the printed out with a laser cutter on an acrylic plate. In our first molds we first created a mold with an air channel and then one without air channel. The middle part (negative part of the air chambers) were glued onto the middle part first, to not create slits in which the silicone could go into. The other parts were glued together with a hot glue gun.
We first tested every mold with water, to test if it would leak. According to that we taped the molds from underneath to prevent the silicone to leak. 

The molds were then filled with silicone. The silicone was mixed by two liquid silicones that would dry out in around 40 minutes. We

# Setup

The Gripper consists of a silicone model with air channels, which are stacked into a air pumping system. The Air pumping system
